              <p class="text-white-75"><a href="https://sgo-workshop.github.io/index_2018.html">Last year’s workshop</a> addressed theoretical aspects of games in machine learning, their special dynamics, and typical challenges. Talks by Costis Daskalakis, Niao He, Jacob Abernethy and Paulina Grnarova emphasized various fundamental topics in a pure, simplified theoretical setting. A number of contributed talks and posters tackled similar questions. The workshop culminated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shyyPIPxwaM&feature=youtu.be&t=86">panel discussion</a> that identified a number of interesting questions:
              <ul class="text-white-75 text-justify">
              <li>How can we integrate learning with game theory?</li>
              <li>How can we inject deep learning into games and vice-versa (eg.  actor-critic formulations can be cast as a game)?</li>
              <li>What are the practical implications and applications? </li>
              <li>How do we go beyond the standard GAN discussion and model general agents that interact with each other in a learning context? </li>
              <li>What can we say about the existence and uniqueness results of equilibria in smooth games.</li>
              <li>Can we approximate mixed equilibria have better properties than the exact ones?~\citep{arora2017generalization,lipton2002simple}</li>
              <li>Finally, how do we design better objectives to match a specific ML task at hand?</li>
            </p>
              <p class="text-white-75">
                We are soliciting contributions that address one of the above questions, or secondarily, another question on the intersection of modern machine learning and games. This year we are particularly interested in accepting work that uses non-standard formulations and applications for games in ML. 
              <h4 class="text-white-75"> Examples of Topics of Interest to the Workshop (beyond the 7 main questions above):</h4>
              <ul class="text-white-75 text-justify">
                We invite researchers to submit work in any related areas, including for example:
                <li>Other examples of smooth games in machine learning (e.g. actor-critic models in RL).</li>
                <li>Standard or novel algorithms to solve smooth games. (e.g. Hamiltonian games [Balduzzi et al. 2018])</li>
                <li>Empirical test of algorithms on GAN applications.</li>
                <li>Existence and unicity results of equilibria in smooth games.</li>
                <li>Can approximate mixed equilibria have better properties than the exact ones ? [Arora 2017, Lipton and Young 1994].</li>
                <li>Variational inequality algorithms [Harker and Pang 1990, Gidel et al. 2018].</li>
                <li>Handling stochasticity [Hazan et al. 2017] or non-convexity [Grnarova et al. 2018] in smooth games.</li>
                <li>Related topics from mathematical programming (e.g. bilevel optimization) [Pfau and Vinyals 2016].</li>
                Please be mindful of the target topics. Topic relevance will be a primordial acceptance criterion.

              <h4 class="text-white-75"> Submission details </h4>
              <p class="text-white-75 text-lg-left">
                A submission should take the form of an <b>anonymous</b> extended abstract (2-4 pages long <b>excluding references</b>) in PDF format using the following <a href="template/neurips_2019.sty">modified NeurIPS style</a>. The submission process will be handled via
                <a href= "https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SGOML2019">CMT</a>.
                Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable, though it needs to be clearly indicated as published work when submitting. Please provide as a footnote in the actual pdf indicating the venue where the work has been submitted.
                Submissions can be accepted as contributed talks, spotlight or poster presentations (all accepted submissions can have a poster). Extended abstracts must be submitted by September 15, 2019 (11:59pm AoE). Final versions will be posted on the workshop website (and are archival but <b>do not constitute a proceedings</b>).

                      Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning have given rise to renewed interest in differentiable two-players games, with much of the attention falling on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Solving these games introduces distinct challenges compared to the standard minimization tasks that the machine learning (ML) community is used to. A symptom of this issue is ML and deep learning (DL) practitioners using optimization tools on game-theoretic problems. Recent work seeks to rectify this situation by bringing game theoretic tools into ML. At NeurIPS 2018 we held “Smooth games optimization in ML”, a workshop with this scope and goal in mind.

                    <a href="https://sgo-workshop.github.io/index_2018.html">Last year’s workshop</a> addressed theoretical aspects of games in machine learning, their special dynamics, and typical challenges. Talks by Costis Daskalakis, Niao He, Jacob Abernethy and Paulina Grnarova emphasized various fundamental topics in a pure, simplified theoretical setting. A number of contributed talks and posters tackled similar questions. The workshop culminated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shyyPIPxwaM&feature=youtu.be&t=86">panel discussion</a> that identified a number of interesting questions.
                    The aim of this workshop is to provide a platform for both theoretical and applied researchers from the ML, mathematical programming and game theory community to discuss the status of our understanding on the interplay between smooth games, their applications in ML, as well existing tools and methods for dealing with them. We are looking for contributions that identifies and discusses open, forward-looking problems of interest to the NeurIPS community. </p>

                    <p class="text-white-75">We are soliciting contributions that address one of the below questions, or secondarily, another question on the intersection of modern machine learning and games. This year we are particularly interested in accepting work that uses non-standard formulations and applications for games in ML. 

                    <ul class="text-white-75 text-justify">
                    <li>How can we integrate learning with game theory?</li>
                    <li>How can we inject deep learning into games and vice-versa (eg.  actor-critic formulations can be cast as a game)?</li>
                    <li>What are the practical implications and applications? </li>
                    <li>How do we go beyond the standard GAN discussion and model general agents that interact with each other in a learning context? </li>
                    <li>What can we say about the existence and uniqueness results of equilibria in smooth games?</li>
                    <li>Can we approximate mixed equilibria have better properties than the exact ones? [Arora, S., Ge, R., Liang, Y., Ma, T., Zhang, 2017]  [Lipton et al., 2002]</li>
                    <li>Can we define a weaker notion of  solution than Nash Equilibria? [Papadimitriou, Piliouras, 2018]</li>
                    <li>Can we compare the quality/performance of Nash equilibria/cycles ? Are there points that have a better quality/outcome than Nash equilibria ? [Kleinberg et al. 2011]</li>
                    <li>How do we design efficient algorithms that are guaranteed to achieve the desired solutions? </li>
                    <li>Finally, how do we design better objectives to match a specific ML task at hand?</li>

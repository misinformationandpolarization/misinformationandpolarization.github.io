            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Overview</h2>
            <p class="text-white-75 text-justify">Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning gave rise to a recent surge of interest in smooth two-players games, specifically in the context of learning generative adversarial networks (GANs). Solving these games raise intrinsically different challenges than the minimization tasks the machine learning community is used to. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the several communities interested in such smooth games, in order to present what is known on the topic and identify current open questions, such as how to handle the non-convexity appearing in GANs.</p>
            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Background and objectives</h2>
            <p class="text-white-75 text-justify">A number of problems and applications in machine learning are formulated as games. A special class of games, smooth games, have come into the spotlight recently with the advent of GANs. In a two-players smooth game, each player attempts to minimize their differentiable cost function which depends also on the action of the other player. The dynamics of such games are distinct from the better understood dynamics of optimization problems. For example, the Jacobian of gradient descent on a smooth two-player game, can be non-symmetric and have complex eigenvalues. Recent work by ML researchers has identified these dynamics as a key challenge for efficiently solving similar problems.
              <br>
              A major hurdle for relevant research in the ML community is the lack of interaction with the mathematical programming and game theory communities where similar problems have been tackled in the past, yielding useful tools. While ML researchers are quite familiar with the convex optimization toolbox from mathematical programming, they are less familiar with the tools for solving games. For example, the extragradient algorithm to solve variational inequalities has been known in the mathematical programming literature for decades, however the ML community has until recently mainly appealed to gradient descent to optimize adversarial objectives.
              <br>
              The aim of this workshop is to provide a platform for both theoretical and applied researchers from the ML, mathematical programming and game theory community to discuss the status of our understanding on the interplay between smooth games, their applications in ML, as well existing tools and methods for dealing with them.
              We also encourage, and will devote time during the workshop, on work that identifies and discusses open, forward-looking problems of interest to the NIPS community.

              <p class="text-white-75 text-lg-left">
                A submission should take the form of an <b>anonymous</b> extended abstract (2-3 pages long <b>excluding references</b>) in PDF format using the following <a href="template/nips_2018.sty">modified NIPS style</a>. The submission process will be handled via CMT. If research has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including NIPS 2018 conference), the workshop submission should extend that previous work and it has to be notified in the submission. Parallel submissions (such as to ICLR or AISTATS) are allowed.
                Submissions can be accepted as contributed talks, spotlight or poster presentations. Extended abstracts must be submitted by Thursday 1 November 2018. Final versions will be posted on the workshop website (and are archival but <b>do not constitute a proceedings</b>).

His research career took him to AT&T Bell Laboratories, AT&T Labs Research, NEC Labs America and Microsoft. He joined Facebook AI Research in 2015.
                    <br>
                    The long term goal of Léon’s research is to understand how to build human-level intelligence. Although reaching this goal requires conceptual advances that cannot be anticipated at this point, it certainly entails clarifying how to learn and how to reason. Leon Bottou best known contributions are his work on “deep” neural networks in the 90s, his work on large scale learning in the 00’s, and possibly his more recent work on causal inference in learning systems. Leon has also recently worked on the geometry of probability measures applied to Generative Adversarial Networks.

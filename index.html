            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Overview</h2>
            <p class="text-white-75 text-justify">Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning gave rise to a recent surge of interest in smooth two-players games, specifically in the context of learning generative adversarial networks (GANs). Solving these games raise intrinsically different challenges than the minimization tasks the machine learning community is used to. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the several communities interested in such smooth games, in order to present what is known on the topic and identify current open questions, such as how to handle the non-convexity appearing in GANs.</p>
            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Background and objectives</h2>
            <p class="text-white-75 text-justify">A number of problems and applications in machine learning are formulated as games. A special class of games, smooth games, have come into the spotlight recently with the advent of GANs. In a two-players smooth game, each player attempts to minimize their differentiable cost function which depends also on the action of the other player. The dynamics of such games are distinct from the better understood dynamics of optimization problems. For example, the Jacobian of gradient descent on a smooth two-player game, can be non-symmetric and have complex eigenvalues. Recent work by ML researchers has identified these dynamics as a key challenge for efficiently solving similar problems.
              <br><br>
              A major hurdle for relevant research in the ML community is the lack of interaction with the mathematical programming and game theory communities where similar problems have been tackled in the past, yielding useful tools. While ML researchers are quite familiar with the convex optimization toolbox from mathematical programming, they are less familiar with the tools for solving games. For example, the extragradient algorithm to solve variational inequalities has been known in the mathematical programming literature for decades, however the ML community has until recently mainly appealed to gradient descent to optimize adversarial objectives.
              <br><br>
              The aim of this workshop is to provide a platform for both theoretical and applied researchers from the ML, mathematical programming and game theory community to discuss the status of our understanding on the interplay between smooth games, their applications in ML, as well existing tools and methods for dealing with them.
              We also encourage, and will devote time during the workshop, on work that identifies and discusses open, forward-looking problems of interest to the NIPS community.

                  Generative Adversarial Networks (aka GANs) are a recently proposed approach for learning samplers of high-dimensional distributions with intricate structure, such as distributions over natural images, given samples from these distributions. They are trained by setting up a two-player zero-sum game between two neural networks, which learn statistics of a target distribution by adapting their strategies in the game using gradient descent. Despite their intriguing performance in practice, GANs pose great challenges to both Optimization and Statistics. Their training suffers from oscillations, and they are difficult to scale to high-dimensional settings. We study how game-theoretic and statistical techniques can be brought to bare on these important challenges. We use Game Theory towards improving GAN training, and Statistics towards scaling up the dimensionality of the generated distributions.

                Constantinos Daskalakis works on computation theory and its interface with game theory, economics, probability theory, statistics and machine learning. His work has resolved long-standing open problems about the computational complexity of Nash equilibrium, the mathematical structure and computational complexity of multi-item auctions, and the behavior of machine-learning methods such as the expectation-maximization algorithm. He has obtained computationally and statistically efficient methods for statistical hypothesis testing and learning in high-dimensional settings, as well as results characterizing the structure and concentration properties of high-dimensional distributions. For his work on the complexity of Nash equilibrium, he has been awarded the Kalai prize from the Game Theory Society and the SIAM outstanding paper prize. He is also a recipient of the ACM doctoral dissertation award, a Simons investigator award, and the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, one of the most prestigious international awards in mathematics.</p>

                    Léon Bottou received the Diplôme d’Ingénieur de l’École Polytechnique (X84) in 1987, the Magistère de Mathématiques Fondamentales et Appliquées et d’Informatique from École Normale Supérieure in 1988, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Université de Paris-Sud in 1991. His research career took him to AT&T Bell Laboratories, AT&T Labs Research, NEC Labs America and Microsoft. He joined Facebook AI Research in 2015.
                    <br>
                    The long term goal of Léon’s research is to understand how to build human-level intelligence. Although reaching this goal requires conceptual advances that cannot be anticipated at this point, it certainly entails clarifying how to learn and how to reason. Leon Bottou best known contributions are his work on “deep” neural networks in the 90s, his work on large scale learning in the 00’s, and possibly his more recent work on causal inference in learning systems. Leon has also recently worked on the geometry of probability measures applied to Generative Adversarial Networks.

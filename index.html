                Advances in generative modeling and adversarial learning have given rise to renewed interest in differentiable two-players games, with much of the attention falling on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Solving these games introduces distinct challenges compared to the standard minimization tasks that the machine learning (ML) community is used to. A symptom of this issue is ML and deep learning (DL) practitioners using optimization tools on game-theoretic problems. Recent work seeks to rectify this situation by bringing game theoretic tools into ML. At NeurIPS 2018 we held “Smooth games optimization in ML”, a workshop with this scope and goal in mind.

              <a href="https://sgo-workshop.github.io/index_2018.html">Last year’s workshop</a> addressed theoretical aspects of games in machine learning, their special dynamics, and typical challenges. Talks by Costis Daskalakis, Niao He, Jacob Abernethy and Paulina Grnarova emphasized various fundamental topics in a pure, simplified theoretical setting. A number of contributed talks and posters tackled similar questions. The workshop culminated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shyyPIPxwaM&feature=youtu.be&t=86">panel discussion</a> that identified a number of interesting questions.
              The aim of this workshop is to provide a platform for both theoretical and applied researchers from the ML, mathematical programming and game theory community to discuss the status of our understanding on the interplay between smooth games, their applications in ML, as well existing tools and methods for dealing with them. We are looking for contributions that identifies and discusses open, forward-looking problems of interest to the NeurIPS community. </p>
              
              <h4 class="text-white-75"> Call for Contributions</h4>
              <p class="text-white-75">We are soliciting contributions that address one of the below questions, or secondarily, another question on the intersection of modern machine learning and games. This year we are particularly interested in accepting work that uses non-standard formulations and applications for games in ML. 

              <ul class="text-white-75 text-justify">
              <li>How can we integrate learning with game theory?</li>
              <li>How can we inject deep learning into games and vice-versa (eg.  actor-critic formulations can be cast as a game)?</li>
              <li>What are the practical implications and applications? </li>
              <li>How do we go beyond the standard GAN discussion and model general agents that interact with each other in a learning context? [Schuurmans et al., 2016] </li>
              <li>What can we say about the existence and uniqueness results of equilibria in smooth games?</li>
              <li>Can we approximate mixed equilibria have better properties than the exact ones? [Arora, S., Ge, R., Liang, Y., Ma, T., Zhang, 2017]  [Lipton et al., 2002]</li>
              <li>Can we define a weaker notion of  solution than Nash Equilibria? [Papadimitriou, Piliouras, 2018]</li>
              <li>Can we compare the quality/performance of Nash equilibria/cycles ? Are there points that have a better quality/outcome than Nash equilibria ? [Kleinberg et al. 2011]</li>
              <li>How do we design efficient algorithms that are guaranteed to achieve the desired solutions? </li>
              <li>Finally, how do we design better objectives to match a specific ML task at hand?</li>

His research career took him to AT&T Bell Laboratories, AT&T Labs Research, NEC Labs America and Microsoft. He joined Facebook AI Research in 2015.
                    <br>
                    The long term goal of Léon’s research is to understand how to build human-level intelligence. Although reaching this goal requires conceptual advances that cannot be anticipated at this point, it certainly entails clarifying how to learn and how to reason. Leon Bottou best known contributions are his work on “deep” neural networks in the 90s, his work on large scale learning in the 00’s, and possibly his more recent work on causal inference in learning systems. Leon has also recently worked on the geometry of probability measures applied to Generative Adversarial Networks.
